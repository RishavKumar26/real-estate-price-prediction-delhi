# Real Estate Price Prediction (Delhi)

This project focuses on predicting real estate prices in Delhi using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to analyze housing data, identify key factors affecting property prices, and build a model that can accurately estimate prices for unseen data.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Collected and processed real estate datasets related to Delhi properties.
- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Built predictive models using Scikit-learn libraries.
- Evaluated models based on performance metrics such as **R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
- Developed insights into how location, area, number of bedrooms, and other features influence property prices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models

## 🚀 Features
- End-to-end **data preprocessing pipeline**.
- Multiple regression models compared for best performance.
- Visualizations to highlight trends and correlations.
- Scalable approach that can be applied to other cities/datasets.

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting property prices.
- Identified **location and area** as the most significant predictors.
- Provided actionable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Incorporate **deep learning models** for improved accuracy.
- Add **interactive dashboards** for price exploration.
- Extend project to cover other metropolitan cities in India.
